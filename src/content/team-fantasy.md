## Team Fantasy

I was motivated to get this project live as soon as I could, in order to be ready for the upcoming NHL season. That meant leveraging as many third-party libraries and frameworks I felt would help me get there. In hindsight, it may have been just as efficient to take a more pared-down approach. After all, it's a fairly simple app, built on a framework–[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)–that turned out to be far more robust than was probably necessary. On top of this, adding [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as an ORM probably only served to add more complexity where the [Supabase API](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/start) would have sufficed. Ditto using [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/); Supabase probably would have been able to handle authentication too, without relying on another library.

If nothing else, this was a good opportunity to learn what these services are capable of, and get a better idea of where they could truly shine. I've put work on this project on hold, with the intention of building another version from scratch with a more thoughtful approach. The main considerations will remain the same; handling authentication and authorization, querying and modeling the data, and hosting solutions for the app and the database. Step one will be to come up with a tech stack that meets these needs without undue complexity.
